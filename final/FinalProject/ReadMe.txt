Food Schedule and Tracker App
By: Christopher Miller

This app is used to keep track and plan out your meals for a week. Currently, you can add 
any food item to the program, add it's nutritional information, and create recipies. You 
are able to add food items to your schedule for the week, and view said schedule for either
the entire week, just a day of the week, or one meal of the current day. You also have the
option of clearing the schedule to start fresh for the next week. You can also see the
combined nutritional data for the meals in a day, or for a specific food item that you
can search for. You may also view the list of all foods that you have added to the program. 
Finally, you can also save your nutritional and food data that you have added to a file,
and load from that file later, so you do not lose that data. You cannot currently save or 
load your schedule. You must make sure your spelling of items is correct, especially for 
nutritional data, and when you add to the schedule. If not, it will not work as intended.
